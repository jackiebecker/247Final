# 247Final
Final Project for 247 -- Eliza v2

To do:
Three prototypes for Monday, testing adding characters alongside Eliza platform.

	1) Basic Eliza -- imported Eliza program w/ no image
	
	2) Living Eliza -- animal/human appearance displayed at top of screen
	
	3) Abstract Eliza -- geometric character form at top of screen
	
Further protyping ideas:

- Will people open up to low-fidelity “AI”?

	- Talk to an online eliza for 5 minutes 
	
- Text someone eliza-esque responses

	- Pre-scripted?
	
- Will people continue to use this app?

- What would make people want to come back?

- Would seeing a character make AI seem more real?

	- Consistent v. inconsistent avatar
	
- What is the best personification of this character (doctor/pet/other)?
