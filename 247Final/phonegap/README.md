Final Project for 247 -- hari

FIRST: Make high-fidelity mock-up in sketch to nail out desired UI

To do:

  1) Some way of telling message is being composed -- spinning wheel, thought bubble, other
  
  2) Expanding input box given overflow, for longer reponses --- put at bottom and have expand upwards
  
  3) No "Submit" button -- implement w/ send/enter on keyboard
  
  4) Users didn't notice character changes. Fix this by either:
  
      - adding animation -- might not be feasible given the way the image is uploaded (by updating css)
      
      - changing text position -- hari's reponses at the top of the screen?
          
          - style as speech bubble?
      
      - other
  
  5) Make character changes more one-dimensional -- no change in color?
  
      - some feedback that character looked like eevee?
  
  6) speech instead of text input from user?
