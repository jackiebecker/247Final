# 247Final
Final Project for 247 -- hari

To do by Tuesday:

	1) Jackie	--- reference sheet, clean up UI, login screen (reset local storage)

	2) Eric 	--- finish up presentation (poster, getting elements together, screenshots)

	3) Jorge	--- testing (5-10 people), describe UX (how they would interact)

	4) Richard	--- get chat window to display prior messages


NOTES: To update the character emotions, go into index.css and change the background-image. Reference sheet will be made.
